## Purpose

This website aims to alleviate that gap by providing a compiled source of data on past graduate program applications across the country. Particularly, it provides a forum where data typically scattered across Reddit and other such platforms can be organized and presented in a neat, easily accessible manner. Undergraduate users will be able to search amongst profiles of current or past graduate students to see their portfolios and the types of research and activities successful applications include. They will be able to search by both the target university and program. They will also be able to access information such as demographics, statement of purpose, and CV. Users who have already applied to graduate school will be able to use the website to upload their portfolio. They will be able to edit their existing data and also create a profile page with contact details and other general information.
